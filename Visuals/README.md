# Dashboard Visuals

This folder contains before-and-after screenshots demonstrating the evolution of a healthcare reporting dashboard.

The visuals illustrate improvements in:

- Survey aggregation logic
- Percent normalization and denominator control
- Layout clarity for executive reporting
- Consistent formatting and labeling
- Stakeholder-ready presentation
- Healthcare performance storytelling

These dashboards are powered by a structured pipeline:

REDCap → Snowflake SQL transformations → Tableau reporting

The goal of the redesign was to replace manual reporting with automated, repeatable analytics workflows that support program oversight and operational decision-making.

Screenshots are included for portfolio demonstration purposes only.
