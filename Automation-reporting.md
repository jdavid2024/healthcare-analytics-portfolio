# Automated Client Experience Reporting System

## Problem
Routine manual reporting required several hours weekly and produced inconsistent outputs.

## Objective
Build an automated reporting pipeline to standardize extraction, validation, and dashboard-ready datasets.

## Tools Used
- Python 
- SQL (Snowflake)
- Tableau
- REDCap data infrastructure

## Approach
1. Developed Python workflows to extract structured data from REDCap source tables
2. Built modular SQL pipelines in Snowflake to ingest and transform data into long-format analytic datasets
3. Designed standardized datasets optimized for dashboard aggregation
4. Automated recurring queries to eliminate manual reporting processes
   
## Results
- Reduced reporting time from 4–6 hours to under 10 minutes
- Improved data consistency and reproducibility 
- Enabled real-time decision support

## Impact
Leadership now depends on automated reporting to guide staffing, capacity planning, and program oversight.
The framework has been expanded to support additional provincial programs, establishing a scalable model for standardized reporting
